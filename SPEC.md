# Controller Logic

## pipeline controller
if not deleting:
assert inputs initialized & labelled
get input data
assert finalizer
if input data changed, assert workflow not running, delete workflow
assert workflow
get workflow state
assert workflow complete
initialized: true
outputs: workflow outputs

If deleting:
assert other workflows not running
assert delete workflow
assert delete workflow complete, retry on error
delete finalizer & workflow


## external watcher controller
assert output = output, initialized
